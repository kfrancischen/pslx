For each container (graph), the node is defined as an operator, and therefore, each operator contains a dictionary of its children operators and parent operators. The execute flow of the container will then start from the root and finish after all the leaf operators are done. Each operator defined in a container will have status of Status.IDLE , Status.WAITING , Status.RUNNING , Status.SUCCEEDED and Status.FAILED . The operator will be in Status.IDLE if its parents are not waiting for being executed, and will be in Status.WAITING if its parents in the process of being executed now. Then it will turn to the status of Status.RUNNING when all its parents are done executing, and its final status could be one of Status.SUCCEEDED and Status.FAILED depending on the execution. One failure in the container graph will result in failure in all the subsequent operators. PSLX has two kinds of data models: DataModelType.BATCH and DataModelType.STREAMING , and the enums are defined as protobuf enums (Please check the section of schema ). DataModelType.BATCH mode supports running operators in multi-thread fashion, and allows each operator to send its status to the backend, while DataModelType.STREAMING only supports sending status to the backend when the container starts and ends. For the execution, DataModelType.STREAMING allows operators to fail in the middle, while for DataModelType.BATCH , one failure in an operator will result in the failure of the overall container. The two types of operations all have the following functions: Operator Documentation \u00b6 Note The base implementation of operator is in operator_base.py , and the ones for the DataModelType.BATCH and DataModelType.STREAMING are in batch/operator.py and streaming/operator.py , respectively. __init__ ( operator_name , logger ) Description: Construct an operator.

To build an RPC service using PSLX, one first needs to take a look at the abstract class implementation defined in rpc_base . The following functions are provided __init__ ( service_name , rpc_storage ) Description: Create an RPC instance with given name and underlying storage. Arguments: service_name: the name of the rpc service. Needs to be unique. rpc_storage: the partitioner storage for storing the GenericRPCRequestResponsePair . If None, the GenericRPCRequestResponsePair won't be stored. Info Function needs to be implemented by specific application. get_response_and_status_impl ( request ) Description: get corresponding response and status from the request. Arguments: request: a proto message containing user defined request information. Explanation: The request and response can be any proto message type user defines. A concrete implementation of RPCBase needs to specify the type of request by setting REQUEST_MESSAGE_TYPE as a class level variable. In addition to inheriting and implementing a RPC class, one also needs to create a client class inheriting client_base . The client_base.py provides the following functions __init__ ( client_name , server_url ) Description: Create an client instance. Arguments: client_name: the name of the rpc client. server_url: the url to the rpc server. send_request ( request ) Description: Send request to the server and get response. Arguments: request: the request proto message. The user of PSLX can also define other function to create a specific request and call send_request inside the function. One example can be found at instant_messaging/client.py . In this example, a customized function send_message wraps the send_request and then allows user to pass more concrete arguments to interact with rpc server. Inside PSLX, RPC requests and responses will finally be parsed as Any proto message and hence the interface is universal. To create a PSLX server, the user of PSLX needs to bind an RPC to a server using the methods provided by generic_server . _init__ ( server_name ) Description: Create an generic server instance. Arguments: server_name: the name of the server. Needs to be unique. create_server ( max_worker , server_url ) Description: Create an generic server. Arguments: max_worker: the maximum number of workers for the server. server_url: the url to the rpc server.

The related enums are defined in schema , and their implementations are in the storage folder. The four stage all inherit from a parent class and storage_base.py , where each inheritance needs to implement its own read and write functions. Besides these two functions, there are a few functions that are shard across all storage types. __init__ ( logger = None ) Description: Construct a storage. Arguments: logger: the logger. Default value is None. set_config ( config ) Description: Updates the initial config. Arguments: config: the config that is added to the existing config. get_storage_type () Description: Get the storage type of the storage. Return: the storage type of the storage, one of StorageType.DEFAULT_STORAGE , StorageType.FIXED_SIZE_STORAGE , StorageType.PROTO_TABLE_STORAGE and StorageType.PARTITIONER_STORAGE . initialize_from_file ( file_name ) Description: initialize the storage from a file, only supported by StorageType.DEFAULT_STORAGE , StorageType.FIXED_SIZE_STORAGE , and StorageType.PROTO_TABLE_STORAGE . Arguments: file_name: the file that is used to initialize the storage. initialize_from_dir ( dir_name ) Description: initialize the storage from a directory, only supported by StorageType.PARTITIONER_STORAGE . Arguments: dir_name: the directory name that is used to initialize the storage. Default Storage Documentation \u00b6 read ( params ) Description: Read from the storage. Arguments: params: the read parameters. Explanation: The underlying file needs to be a text file, and the default storage supports read/write from both top and down (see the definition of ReadRuleType and WriteRuleType in schema ), and can be set by function set_config(config) by overwriting string read_rule_type and write_rule_type with the correct enum. The default values for them are ReadRuleType.READ_FROM_BEGINNING and WriteRuleType.WRITE_FROM_END . The params in the read(params) function supports the number of lines to read from the file. The way to set this field is to pass num_line to the param (a dictionary). If the num_line exceeds the total number of lines in the file, an error will be raised. After reading the underlying file, the file handler will move accordingly. For example, after reading one line from the file, the second time the storage will start by reading the second line of the file. The can be reset by calling start_from_first_line() . write ( data , params ) Description: Write to the storage. Arguments: data: the write parameters. Explanation: If the data is a string, it will be written to the underlying file from top or bottom depending on the value of write_rule_type . If the data is a list, it will be joined with delimter set in the params. If key delimiter is not present in params, comma will be used by default. start_from_first_line () Description: Reset the reader to read from the first line (from top or bottom). Proto Table Storage \u00b6 read ( params ) Description: Read from the storage. Arguments: params: the read parameters. Explanation: proto table is a key-value storage, and therefore the params need to contain field of key . The value of the proto table is a proto message, and if the field of message_type is provided, the reader will correctly deserialize to the desired protobuf. Otherwise it will only an Any type message. Under PSLX convention, the underlying file name needs to end with .pb . read_multiple ( params ) Description: Read multiple key from the storage. Arguments: params: the read parameters. Explanation: proto table is a key-value storage, and therefore the params need to contain field of keys , which is a list. read_all () Description: Read all the data. Return: the key, value dictionary of the table, with value being the Any proto format. write ( data , params ) Description: Write to the storage. Arguments: data: the write parameters. Explanation: The data needs to be a dictionary of key, value with key being a string and value being a protobuf message of any user defined types. The params can contain overwrite with its value a boolean indicating whether to overwrite the value if the key already exists in the proto table. delete ( key ) Description: Delete key and the corresponding entry from the proto table. Arguments: key: the key of the entry to be deleted. delete_multiple ( keys ) Description: Delete keys and the corresponding entry from the proto table. Arguments: keys: the list of keys of the entries to be deleted. delete_all () Description: Delete all the contents from the proto table. Sharded Proto Table Storage \u00b6 Sharded proto table storage will shard the data into different proto tables, denoted by data@SHARD.pb , where the SHARD is an integer that starts from 0 . In addition to these tables, there also exists a index_map.pb protobuf that stores the metadata information such as the mapping between each key and the shard that it belongs to, the latest shard, and the maximum size per shard. __init__ ( size_per_shard = None , logger = None ) Description: To initialize a sharded proto table storage with size_per_shard for each shard. Arguments: size_per_shard: the size per shard. This has to be set if the sharded proto table is newly created, and can be set None if the table already exists. logger: please see the storage_base definition. read ( params ) Description: Read from the storage. Arguments: params: the read parameters. Explanation: proto table is a key-value storage, and therefore the params need to contain field of key . Return: the value to the key, None if key does not exist. read_multiple ( params ) Description: Read from the storage. Arguments: params: the read parameters. Explanation: proto table is a key-value storage, and therefore the params need to contain field of keys , which is a list of keys in the storage. Return: a dictionary of key-values, where keys might be a subset of the input keys in the params for which the key exists in the sharded proto table storage. read_all () Description: Read all the data from the storage write ( data , params ) Description: Write to the storage. Arguments: data: the write parameters. Explanation: The data needs to be a dictionary of key, value with key being a string and value being a protobuf message of any user defined types. The params can contain overwrite with its value a boolean indicating whether to overwrite the value if the key already exists in the proto table. Partitioner Storage \u00b6 Note The base class implementation of partitioners is in partitioner_base.py , it uses an underlying tree structure defined in tree_base.py . In PSLX, five types of partitioners are supported: 1. PartitionerStorageType.MINUTELY : the underlying directory will be format of 2020/03/01/00/59/ . 2. PartitionerStorageType.HOURLY : the underlying directory will be format of 2020/03/01/00/ . 3. PartitionerStorageType.DAILY : the underlying directory will be format of 2020/03/01/ . 4. PartitionerStorageType.MONTHLY : the underlying directory will be format of 2020/03/ . 5. PartitionerStorageType.YEARLY the underlying directory will be format of 2020/ . All the partitioners share with the following functions. The choice of partition type would depend on the data size. It is recommended that if the data size is huge, a more fine grained storage ( PartitionerStorageType.MINUTELY ) is used, and vice versa. set_underlying_storage ( storage ) Description: Set underlying storage behind the partitioner. Arguments: storage: any storage among StorageType.DEFAULT_STORAGE , StorageType.FIXED_SIZE_STORAGE , and StorageType.PROTO_TABLE_STORAGE . set_max_capacity ( max_capacity ) Description: Set the maximum capacity of the partitioner. Arguments: max_capacity: the maximum capacity (number of file nodes) stored in the partitioner, negative meaning the partitioner will store all the file nodes. set_config ( config ) Description: Set the config for the underlying storage. Arguments: config: the config that is added to the existing config of the underlying storage. get_dir_name () Description: Get the directory name that the partitioner is initialized from.

Arguments: params: the read parameters. Explanation: The underlying storage might prefer a different file name stored in each partition, hence base_name is an arg in params. The default base_name is data for StorageType.DEFAULT_STORAGE and StorageType.FIXED_SIZE_STORAGE , and data.pb for StorageType.PROTO_TABLE_STORAGE . One can also set reinitialize_underlying_storage if one wants the storage to be reinitialized. The read only load data from the latest directory. read_range ( data , params ) Description: Read a range of files from the storage. Arguments: params: the read parameters. Explanation: The params must contain start_time and end_time in order for the partitioner to retrieve files with partition within the given time range. The interval is a close interval. The return from this function will be a dictionary with file name as the key and file content as the value. If the underlying storage is a proto table, the value in the output dict will be in the format of {key_1: val_1, ... ..., key_n: val_n} with all the val_i being an Any type message. write ( data , params ) Description: Write to the storage. Arguments: data: the write parameters. Explanation: The underlying storage might prefer a different file name stored in each partition, hence base_name is an arg in params. The default base_name is data for StorageType.DEFAULT_STORAGE and StorageType.FIXED_SIZE_STORAGE , and data.pb for StorageType.PROTO_TABLE_STORAGE . If make_partition is in the params and it is set False, the partition will not make new partition for the new incoming data, otherwise ( make_partition unset or set True), it will make partition based on the current timestamp. If an extra timezone field is set, the partitioner will make a new partition based on the timezone. Possible timezone could be PST , EST or UTC . If not set, the default time zone is PST . Info Debug only. print_self () Description: Print the internal file tree.","title":"Data Storage"},{"location":"storage.html#default-storage-documentation","text":"read ( params ) Description: Read from the storage. Arguments: params: the read parameters. Explanation: The underlying file needs to be a text file, and the default storage supports read/write from both top and down (see the definition of ReadRuleType and WriteRuleType in schema ), and can be set by function set_config(config) by overwriting string read_rule_type and write_rule_type with the correct enum. The default values for them are ReadRuleType.READ_FROM_BEGINNING and WriteRuleType.WRITE_FROM_END . The params in the read(params) function supports the number of lines to read from the file. The way to set this field is to pass num_line to the param (a dictionary). If the num_line exceeds the total number of lines in the file, an error will be raised. After reading the underlying file, the file handler will move accordingly. For example, after reading one line from the file, the second time the storage will start by reading the second line of the file. The can be reset by calling start_from_first_line() . write ( data , params ) Description: Write to the storage. Arguments: data: the write parameters. Explanation: If the data is a string, it will be written to the underlying file from top or bottom depending on the value of write_rule_type . If the data is a list, it will be joined with delimter set in the params. If key delimiter is not present in params, comma will be used by default. start_from_first_line () Description: Reset the reader to read from the first line (from top or bottom).","title":"Default Storage Documentation"},{"location":"storage.html#proto-table-storage","text":"read ( params ) Description: Read from the storage.

To bind the subscriber to the operator, one can use: bind_to_op ( op ) An example subscriber of the above publisher is from pslx.streaming.operator import StreamingOperator from pslx.streaming.container import DefaultStreamingContainer from pslx.micro_service.pubsub.subscriber import Subscriber from pslx.schema.rpc_pb2 import HealthCheckerRequest from pslx.util.dummy_util import DummyUtil class SubscriberExampleOp ( StreamingOperator ): def __init__ ( self ): super () . __init__ ( operator_name = 'subscriber_example_op' ) @staticmethod def pubsub_msg_parser ( exchange_name , topic_name , message ): print ( exchange_name , topic_name , message ) def execute_impl ( self ): subscriber = Subscriber ( connection_str = 'amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672' ) subscriber . bind_to_op ( self ) subscriber . subscribe ( exchange_name = 'test_exchange_1' , topic_name = 'test1' , message_type = HealthCheckerRequest ) subscriber . subscribe ( exchange_name = 'test_exchange_2' , topic_name = 'test2' , message_type = HealthCheckerRequest ) subscriber . start () class SubscriberExampleContainer ( DefaultStreamingContainer ): def __init__ ( self ): super () . __init__ ( container_name = 'subscriber_example_container' ) if __name__ == \"__main__\" : op = SubscriberExampleOp () container = SubscriberExampleContainer () container . add_operator_edge ( from_operator = op , to_operator = DummyUtil . dummy_streaming_operator ()) container . initialize () container . execute ()","title":"Publisher/Subscriber"}]}
